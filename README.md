# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch TOP project 

1. Create a webpage with a 16 x 16 grid.
    - Create the divs with Javascript
    - Create the grid squares inside a "container"
    - Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
    - Use CSS stylings to outline the boxes;
    - Establish the 16 x 16 as the default behavior 

2. Create a hover effect that will change the div color
    - This should create a "paper trail" effect coloring in the squares
    - Bonus points for being able to randomize the color

3. Add a button at the top, that sends the user a pop up askying for the number of squares per side
    - This will be used to make the grid size
    - Limit the max number to be 100
    -Personal choice, have the button text display the grid size eg "16 x 16"
